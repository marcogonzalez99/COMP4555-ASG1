# This project was for an assignment for the Games Development introduction course at Mount Royal University.The purpose of this project was for us, the students, to put into practice some basic/intermediate python coding skills while learning some key components of pygame with a base game of Space Invaders. We were introduced to various new elements such as the concept of a bullet, collision, win conditions and more important, the concept of levels and advancement. Each team member was responsible for designing a level within our Space Invaders game. 

# The follow fundemental elements were changed within each level:
# For each level, the space ship the player controls appearance wise is different
# Different background music for each level
# Different background image for each level
# Different laser sound for each level
# A new alien is added each level
# A different victory sound is played after the completion of a level
# There is an increase in the number of enemies and their speed per level
# Increase in the amount of points awarded for each alien in each level and an added bonus for the level completion 


# As a group we chose to adhere to the original space theme of the Space Invaders but chose mostly to our own preferences but took into consideration each others choices. We all chose a darker and simple star based background to set the space atmosphere but to not distract the player from the enemies they are to be focussed on. The style of the spaceships we chose are similar in structure to avoid the feeling of disconnect between the levels. The colour scheme of the ships for each level were chosen to each member's liking. As for the sound effects and music selection, we agreed upon a common theme of using 8 bit music. We each chose effects and music tracks that are similar to one another but still different at they take into account our personal tastes. Lastly for the aliens used, again for a sense of coherence we chose to use designs from just a single set. Lastly for the win condition of each level we stuck true to the original game, where the elimination of all aliens would trigger the completion of a level.

# Specifically when it came to the addition of aliens per level, this is implemented with both increasing them through the addition of rows or columns.

# Installation:
# The files for the game itself once downloaded will be contained within a zip folder, ensure the extraction of all files and folders have been completed and within the same location. To run the game, python and the library pygame is required. The game can easily be run through a terminal, calling uplon the main file space_invaders.py.
