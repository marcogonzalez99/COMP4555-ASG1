# Matthew Baluyot - Created a wall mod in where it would display a wall in a randomly generated location for the session. This would improve gameplay by increasing or decreasing the difficulty depending on where the wall has been placed.

# Brian Atuh - Added Redirect Mode. Allows the player to reverse the Y trajectory of the ball if they are moving in the opposing direction. This gives the player more control of the gameplay, and therefore, adds a layer of skill that advanced players can utilize against the opponent.
